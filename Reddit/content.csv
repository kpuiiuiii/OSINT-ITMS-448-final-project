However I don't know *exactly* how much involvement the US had in what the Talibs taught. The US *did* (secretly) distribute a commonly used schoolbook with jihadist imagerywhich was used by the Talibanso it was definitely not a hands off approach but I can't say for certain just how much involvement we had with the Talibs compared to KSA and Pakistan


And you're right that the US mostly left the picture in the 90s, but the seeds they planted set the stage for the Taliban.

My grandfather, born in France with a French passport to Italian parents, committed some kind of crime while living in Italy (we think it was bad?  Maybe murder?) and in order to flee he joined the French Foreign Legion to get a clean slate.  He ended up going AWOL after a year or so, returned to France with his actual French passport, realizing France had no idea about his crime in Italy and then immigrated to the US.

Upon immigrating to the US he joined the Army and served/completed his enlistment.  

Basically France had no idea a French citizen had joined because he pretended to be Italian without papers.

A Legionnaire, on the other hand, is literally considered less valuable than the rifles they're issued for a time (I know that's actually pretty common in the military, but it demonstrates the mindset these guys are molded into). Even politically, the Legion has been seen as a bit of a crutch by the French government, a military force that can be safely used without backlash from most people at home about deploying French personnel overseas.

No unit is anymore when the cost of losing men, both politically and financially, is so high.

Not to be disrespectful but the last bit of your comment is wrong, although we do hear that a lot. Im talking about the the FFL can be deployed without major backlash. It might very well have been true decades ago (mostly when the FFL was created, around 1830) but it quickly changed and for the most part of its history, the FFL was never deployed without units from other classic regiments, which illustrates the fact that it wasnt necessarily seen differently. The one exception would be the War of Indochina during which the FFL was extensively used compared with other units, but even there it fought alongside parachutistes regiments, colonial regiments (which are not necessarily made of non-French contrary to what their names suggest), infanterie de marine (the French Marines) regiments etc, that is to say not expendable units but renown, tough units, better fit for expeditionary warfare.","France announces it has killed the leader of Al Qaeda in North Africa during an operation in Mali","","https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/world-africa-52943692?__twitter_impression=true","bbc.co.uk","http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/gxcnor/france_announces_it_has_killed_the_leader_of_al/?ref=search_posts"

What I was trying to get at was what you said, that the FFL is certainly elite given how harsh its training is, but its scope of operations - infantry, paratroopers, combat engineers, armor etc. - doesn't include special operations like we'd normally think. I also didn't mean to phrase it like some lives were worth more than others - that's absolutely not the case, but rather what the FFL is more ""mundane"" (again for lack of a better word) than the covert operations we traditionally associate with special forces.

&gt; France says it has killed the leader of al-Qaeda in north Africa, Abdelmalek Droukdel, in an operation in Mali.

&gt; Droukdel was in charge of all the al-Qaeda affiliates in north Africa and also commanded al-Qaeda&amp;#039;s Sahel affiliate, Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin, which has been active in Mali and Burkina Faso.

&gt; The captured Islamic State group commander, Mohamed Mrabat, was a veteran jihadist and had a senior role in the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara group, she said.

Daily life included calls to prayer, and busy markets with lots of fruit, clothing, and exotic stuff. French and bambara were the languages they spoke.

When Gadaffi's was overthrown, the Malian government went into disarray, because Gaddaffi was giving the country lots of money and building infrastructure including the presidential buildings, airport, and highways.

Edit: the regular folks attitude towards Gaddafi was very positive and I recall that most viewed it as a national tragedy. Buses had his images painted on it , the politicians discussed him, and there was a focus on the arab world, it seemed, instead of Africa. The Taureg in the north were the most dangerous at the time because they viewed themselves as more independent then the Malian government viewed them as, particularly at Tax time.

I don't think at that time the country understood the Islamic geopolitical situation that was ensuing but I think there was an understanding that gold shiny things would no longer be built in the country.

Trouble began when I was there: the Arab Spring was happening in the North, the teachers and workers had not been paid, the soldiers had checkpoints and guns, and the people were uneasy. Not only were they afraid of the Northern Malian extremists but they were also struggling to survive the saharan droughts. I never felt unsafe.. but I was 18 so I don't think I understood what the risks were either. I was there for 6 months en le langue francais.

That means the heat is dry which means you just need to drink a lot of water and your sweat will do the rest. Also because it's dry heat you can use passive coolers (basically water evaporators, they don't use electricity) to cool indoor places to much more manageable levels. For this reason tropical regions paradoxically carry a much higher risk of heat stroke than deserts (if you have enough water to drink that is), where despite the temperatures only peaking in the 30s usually (Celsius, obv), you have humidity approaching 100% and so the temperature regulation of your body does not work at all or is severely impeded.

Saying that, you do need to wear a lot of clothing especially on the head because air temperature is one thing, but the sun will also heat up your body directly (to much higher temperatures than the air). An example of this is when you touch the roof of a car on a sunny summer day, it will be much hotter than the surrounding air temperature.","France announces it has killed the leader of Al Qaeda in North Africa during an operation in Mali","","https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/world-africa-52943692?__twitter_impression=true","bbc.co.uk","http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/gxcnor/france_announces_it_has_killed_the_leader_of_al/?ref=search_posts"

Definitely pay extra for first class or bring a mosquito net tent and camp out on the bow. Warning: the trip to Timbuktu takes several days and the trip is tough. Once there, you can pay guides to you into the Sahara via camel for a day or two. Definitely worth the money. 

In my opinion traveling to Timbuktu is more about being able to say that you went there than the overall beauty. It is an extremely unique experience though. 

Traveling to manatali is on the other end of the country is amazing. Theres a big lake there with a hydroelectric damn that powers part of Mali as well as a major chunk of Senegal. To get there you have to take a bus and then a miniatures bus called a banshee. Both vehicles are usually filled with goats, chickens, babies, the elderly, teenagers, and sometimes old guys in strange outfits that carry rifles and hunt for a living. Be prepared to listen to loud music that sounds like Star Wars 70s disco while being in an vehicle with 5 time the legal capacity of people. 

Right before you get to manatali, the road drops. Its like entering a giant crater with sharp turns and tight roads. The base is a beautiful lake where you can cliff dive and go to a funky bar full of pictures of nude playmates. Its run by South Africans that work at the dam. No other bar is like this in the country. Its a complete disrespectful of culture but accepted because its so remote. 

The lake goes into a river that is full of hippos. Absolutely beautiful. 

From there you can take a train and enter Senegal. The train is completely overcrowded. Pay extra for first class and be prepared to stop every thirty minutes for everyone to pee and poop in the woods. 

The trains average speed is 15 mph. Imagine a ringling brothers train pulling up to Chicago in the early 1920s. This is it. 

Otherwise, there are major roads going north to south and east to west. They are barely two lanes with no lines in the middle. Full of pot holes. And busses stop every thirty minutes at military check points where guards try shake downs. Its not scary. Just learn basic Bambara or French and all is well. 

Warning: transportation is by far the most dangerous thing in this country. Two peace corps folks died while I was in country. Several more were injured. It can be scary.

France killed Abdelmalek Droukdel, the leader of what is called AQIM (al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb). Primarily operates in parts of Algeria, Mali, Libya, Niger, and Mauritania. Used to be called GSPC until roughly 2007 when it joined AQ. Before that it was the GIA, an extremely brutal faction in the Algerian civil war. Now they generate massive amounts of cash through drug and cigarette smuggling in Northern Africa. Theyre also particularly adept at kidnapping and ransoming westerners. They use this money to influence and radicalize individuals and organizations throughout Northern Africa, carry out attacks, and partner with Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab. 

The leader of al-Qaeda is Ayman al-Zawahiri, and hes been the primary shot caller since UBL was killed if not sooner.
