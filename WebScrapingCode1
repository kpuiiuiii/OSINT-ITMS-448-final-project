# Assuming you have pip installed already ->
# Make sure you have both BeautifulSoup and Requests install:
#pip install beautifulsoup4
#pip install requests
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
# with the requests module we use the get function and put the website into a variable
result = requests.get("https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/")
# we can put the result content into a variable called src
src = result.content
# We can put the src var into  Beautiful Soup
soup = BeautifulSoup(src, 'lxml')
# we wanna get a list of links - urls var
urls = []
for h2_tag in soup.find_all('h2'): # find all the h2 tags - Inspected element shows a href links are stored in h2 header tags
        a_tag = h2_tag.find('a') # specify that we are searching for the a tags in the h2 header elements
        urls.append(a_tag) # add it to the urls var to get a list of a href links 

print(urls)
